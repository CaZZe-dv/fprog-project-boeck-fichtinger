# fprog-project-boeck-fichtinger

# Project Description
This C++ project processes "War and Peace" by Tolstoy, extracts unique words (ignoring punctuation and numbers), and inserts them into a red-black tree. After inserting the words, the program outputs a sorted list to a file called output.txt.

# Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang)
Make (build automation tool)

# Compilation & Execution
make
./program
Optionally, specify an input and output file:
./program <inputFile> [outputFile]

# Notes
The program ensures that only unique words (without punctuation or numbers) are processed and stored in the Red-Black Tree.
The sorted list of words will be output to a file named output.txt by default.
